# Lesson 1 — What is Flutter?

## Definition

**Flutter** is an **open-source UI toolkit by Google** for building **cross-platform applications** —  
**Android, iOS, Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux** — using a **single codebase** written in **Dart**.

---

### Key Difference

Unlike other frameworks, **Flutter does not use native UI components.**  
It **renders every pixel on the screen itself.**

This gives Flutter:

- **Identical UI** on every platform  
- **Blazing-fast performance**  
- **Full control** over look, feel, and animation  

---

## Why Flutter Exists

Before Flutter, cross-platform frameworks like **React Native** or **Cordova** relied on:

- Bridges between JavaScript and native code  
- Native widgets that differ between OS versions  

This caused:

- **Performance lag**  
- **Inconsistent UIs**  
- **Complicated maintenance**

Flutter solves this by **bypassing the OEM widget system entirely** —  
it **paints directly on the screen** via **Skia**, Google’s **GPU-accelerated 2D graphics engine**.

---

## Flutter’s Goal

- **One codebase, all platforms**  
- **Native performance (60–120 FPS)**  
- **Developer-friendly (Hot Reload)**  
- **Beautiful, consistent UI**

## 🧩 Flutter Architecture Overview

| Layer | Description | Key Components |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Your Flutter App (Dart)** | The app you build — contains UI, logic, and state. | - Widgets<br>- State<br>- Business Logic |
| **Flutter Framework (Dart)** | Provides core building blocks and APIs for UI creation and behavior. | - Widget Layer<br>- Rendering Layer<br>- Animation & Gestures |
| **Flutter Engine (C++)** | Low-level runtime responsible for rendering and execution. | - Skia Graphics Library<br>- Dart Runtime (JIT/AOT)<br>- Text, Image, GPU Handling |
| **Embedder (Platform)** | Connects Flutter to the underlying operating system. | - Android (Java/Kotlin)<br>- iOS (Swift/Objective-C)<br>- Desktop/Linux (C++) |


# Flutter Architecture — The 3 Core Layers

Flutter is structured into **three main layers**, each with a distinct purpose — from your Dart code down to the platform itself.

---

## 1. Framework Layer

**Language:** Dart  
**Purpose:** Where *you* write your app’s code.

This is the **high-level layer** developers interact with directly.

**Responsible for:**

- Building **widget trees**  
- Handling **gestures and input**  
- Triggering **UI rebuilds** when state changes  

**Sub-layers inside the Framework:**

- **Widgets Layer** — everything you see on the screen (UI components)  
- **Rendering Layer** — positions, layouts, and paints widgets  
- **Foundation Layer** — basic building blocks and core utilities (like `ChangeNotifier`, `BuildContext`, etc.)

---

## 2. Engine Layer

**Language:** C++  
**Purpose:** Performs all the **heavy lifting** for rendering and runtime.

**Responsible for:**

- Rendering UI via **Skia** (Google’s 2D graphics engine)  
- Running **Dart code** via the **Dart runtime**  
- **Text shaping** with **HarfBuzz**  
- **Image decoding** and **GPU interfacing**  
- **Accessibility support**

This layer is **platform-agnostic** — it doesn’t care whether it’s Android, iOS, or Web.

---

## 3. Embedder Layer

**Language:** Platform-specific (Java/Kotlin, Objective-C/Swift, C++, etc.)  
**Purpose:** The bridge between Flutter and the host OS.

**Responsible for:**

- **Launching the Flutter engine**  
- Creating a **surface to draw on** (e.g., Android’s `SurfaceView`)  
- Handling **input events** (touch, keyboard, mouse)  
- Communicating with **native OS APIs** (camera, GPS, etc.)  

Uses **Platform Channels** to exchange messages between **Flutter (Dart)** and **native code**.

---

# Lesson 3 — The Widget Tree, Element Tree & Render Tree

When you write:

**Text('Hello Flutter');**


you’re creating a Widget, but widgets are immutable blueprints — they describe what the UI should look like.

Flutter builds three parallel trees internally:

| **Tree**         | **Purpose**                               | **Type**          | **Mutable?** |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Widget Tree      | Blueprint / configuration                 | Dart objects      |    Immutable |
| Element Tree     | Connection between widget and render      | Bridge objects    |    Mutable   |
| Render Tree      | Actual layout, paint, compositing         | Render objects    |    Mutable   |

## The Lifecycle

- You build widgets → Flutter creates a Widget Tree
- Each widget creates an Element that manages its lifecycle
- Each Element holds a RenderObject that calculates layout and paints visuals
- When something changes (like state), only affected widgets rebuild → the element updates → render object repaints efficiently
- This separation gives Flutter its incredible speed and reactivity.
